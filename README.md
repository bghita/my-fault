<h1>My Fault React App</h1>

Earthquakes happend daily, some more than others. It's frightning to know about the studies and researchers telling us of the big earthquake 
waiting to hit San Andreas fault.. so shouldnt we all be prepared? Why do we still procrastinate? Thats why i believe its important to 
create an app that alerts you of a earthquake 100 miles near you. So that when it does happen you'r one step ahead. Their are numerouse 
resources links users can use to educate themselves with creating a earthquake kit for work, school and travel.
